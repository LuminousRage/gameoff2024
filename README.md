# Chameleon: Game Off 2024
Entry for [Game Off 2024](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2024).
See our game on [itch.io](https://luminousrage.itch.io/chameleon)/

Charmeleon is a 2D/3D dimension-weaving puzzle adventure game, where you play a game that distorts reality. Will you let the colours shape who you are, or will you protect what you hold dear?
